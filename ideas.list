- Statically type players which support different subsets of the kingdom cards
  - Can play in any kingdom with a superset of those kingdom cards available
    - Exceptions:
      * Black Market
      * Masquerade & other cards that allow trading

- Enumerable
- Free Monad vs just interface on the monad

- Do I even need dependent types?
